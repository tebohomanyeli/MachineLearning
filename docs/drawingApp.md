# Interactive Drawing Application

This project provides a simple, yet feature-rich, drawing application that you can run in your web browser. The application supports various inputs, including mouse movements and touch screen gestures, and includes an undo button to erase the last drawing action. 

## Features

- Support for mouse and touch screen inputs.
- Undo functionality to erase the last drawing action.
- User-friendly interface designed with HTML and CSS.
- Logic encapsulated within two JavaScript classes for maintainability.

## Structure

The project is divided into four main files:

- `creator.html`: This is the HTML file that structures the web application.
- `styles.css`: This file contains all the styles used in the application.
- `draw.js`: This JavaScript file contains the 'drawingFunctions' object, which handles the actual drawing procedures on the canvas.
- `sketchPad.js`: This JavaScript file defines the 'SketchPad' class. This class represents the main drawing area, handling user inputs and managing the drawing state.

## Getting Started
